## Supported Applications & Repositories

This is a list of the supported applications.<br>
Supported applications are currently extended as long as it is reasonable effort for me to create and maintain the repositories.
The main development of the themes is for Notepad++ and Windows Terminal, which won't change during this project.<br>

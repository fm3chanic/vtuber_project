# The Vtuber Theming Project

During this project I've created color schemes based on Vtubers (form of content creators) and built themes for plain texteditors and terminal emulators out of them.<br>
The project was partially documented on [Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/@fm3chanic).

## Background

The place where I am working has only a limited pool of supported applications and very strict ruling of introducing new ones when other applications basically cover the functionality of the application you'd like to add. To make things worse we have to use Windows.<br>
I haven't figured out yet how to edit code just by willpower, so unfortunately I need a texteditor and ideally one that is lightweight. So VSCode which technically would be supported isn't an option. I was left with an veeeery old version of Emacs or Notepad++ which receives updates regularly. I went with Notepad++.<br>
I don't know how you feel, but I can't use the same theme for months, at a certain point I need a change. The number of maintained themes for Notepad++ is unfortunately not that high. So I decided one day, I am building my own theme. The result was a theme based on an anime character (Sakura Haruno from Naruto). This was basically the day where the idea for this project was born.<br>

When a theme based on an anime character is possible, then a theme based on a Vtuber would also be possible! So why not creating a theme based on a Vtuber? But which one? At his point I had already more than 10 content creators in mind, so instead of trying to choose one of them I made a project out of it.
